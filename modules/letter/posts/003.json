    "There is one old idea I like to return to on Valentine’s Day.",
    "People say that between two individuals there can exist an invisible connection. Not something mystical. Not something written by fate. Simply a connection that forms when two people truly meet.",
    "It does not appear in a single evening. It is not created by beautiful words. It grows from respect, from honesty, from small, consistent actions.",
    "Sometimes it is strong. Sometimes it is fragile. And sometimes we weaken it ourselves when we accept less than we deserve.",
    "Many believe love means finding someone who will hold that connection carefully in their hands. But the truth is — you hold it first.",
    "The way you treat yourself becomes the foundation of every future love. If you allow yourself to be diminished, the connection becomes painful. If you ignore your feelings, it begins to tear. If you betray yourself for someone else’s comfort, it stops being real.",
    "Real love does not demand proof. It does not require enduring humiliation. It does not ask you to become smaller.",
    "It creates stability. Without anxiety. Without fear of losing yourself.",
    "Today many people will celebrate. Some with a partner. Some alone. Some in the middle of letting go.",
    "And in every one of these situations, it is important to remember: Your worth does not increase because someone chose you. And it does not decrease because someone didn’t.",
    "The connection that truly matters begins within you.",
    "Love does not always look like romance. Often it looks like maturity. Like respect. Like the decision not to stay where it hurts.",
    "Love does not save those who forget themselves. It comes to those who know how not to betray themselves.",
    "And perhaps that is exactly why it has the power to change the world."
